00:01.907 --> 00:03.507
Inexperienced

00:03.507 --> 00:05.280
heartless,

00:05.280 --> 00:07.406
but even so,

00:07.907 --> 00:15.067
Be Beautiful

00:22.887 --> 00:26.007
No Destiny, unworthy

00:26.007 --> 00:27.907
If we just talk as if it's never enough

00:27.907 --> 00:29.606
“If it's like this, then probably things will go well”

00:29.607 --> 00:32.007
Things, money, love,words,

00:32.007 --> 00:36.807
I'm tired of self-asserting myself already

00:37.727 --> 00:41.107
Déjà vu, what are you so unsatisfied about？

00:41.107 --> 00:42.807
You've said all sorts of selfish things.

00:42.807 --> 00:44.606
What more could you possibly want？

00:44.607 --> 00:50.347
But surprise, I don't hate this situation.

00:51.967 --> 00:55.207
Already,
"I'm sick of hearing that line"

00:55.407 --> 00:58.807
The one thing I don't want is ambiguousness!

00:58.807 --> 01:00.007
Enough!

01:00.007 --> 01:01.607
Even if you say to do this or that,

01:01.607 --> 01:03.467
Even if you say love me, or why?

01:03.467 --> 01:05.106
It's easy if it's just for fun.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.807
And that it's reckless serious negotiating

01:06.807 --> 01:10.807
Those contemptuous and surprising words.

01:10.807 --> 01:13.647
How many times do you want to use?

01:13.647 --> 01:14.707
Anyway,

01:14.707 --> 01:16.607
I was hoping it even in a fixed game,

01:16.607 --> 01:18.206
Even all those quoted phrases,

01:18.207 --> 01:19.907
The words make people tiptoe.

01:19.907 --> 01:22.607
let these things become taboo.

01:22.607 --> 01:29.406
Take a hint, don't let it rain.

01:40.407 --> 01:47.507
I hate talking in a roundabout way.

01:48.207 --> 01:55.007
If you must speak, 
"Answer it within two words."

01:55.287 --> 02:02.527
Red butterfly, even a letter can not be served

02:02.707 --> 02:06.107
Spreading a  fragile folding fan.

02:06.107 --> 02:09.706
That is more attractive, isn't it?

02:09.706 --> 02:10.607
Confused.

02:10.607 --> 02:12.407
If you can't answer, please leave me alone.

02:12.407 --> 02:14.307
If you can't stop hesitating, please leave me.

02:14.307 --> 02:16.007
The key words, but you don't listen.

02:16.007 --> 02:18.607
If it is only for the sake of peace of mind and then fall...

02:18.607 --> 02:21.407
Sweet raindrops.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.507
You also want to hold up the umbrella, right？

02:24.507 --> 02:25.307
Like this,

02:25.307 --> 02:26.927
I hope I can always look forward to it.

02:26.927 --> 02:27.906
I closed my eyes.

02:27.907 --> 02:28.707
I wanted to change.

02:28.707 --> 02:29.707
Pretending to be an adult.

02:29.907 --> 02:30.607
Lost.

02:30.607 --> 02:33.507
But things are irreparable.

02:33.707 --> 02:36.406
Now, please don't stop raining.

02:36.407 --> 02:40.387
Copy,

02:40.387 --> 02:42.207
Paste,

02:42.207 --> 02:44.007
Delete.

02:44.047 --> 02:47.207
Repeat these actions.

02:47.707 --> 02:49.507
Breathe in,

02:49.507 --> 02:50.407
Breathe out.

02:50.707 --> 02:55.207
So, ah…

02:55.207 --> 02:56.866
Even so...It doesn't matter,

02:56.867 --> 02:57.907
this is a heartache love!

02:57.907 --> 02:58.807
That's enough!!

02:58.807 --> 03:00.707
Even if you say to do this or that,

03:00.707 --> 03:02.607
Even if you say love me, or why?

03:02.607 --> 03:04.306
It's easy if it's just for fun.

03:04.307 --> 03:06.007
And that it's fragmented serious negotiating

03:06.007 --> 03:09.607
Those contemptuous and heavy lies (truth).

03:09.607 --> 03:12.866
Let these things all become taboo.

03:13.007 --> 03:13.807
(Request tone) Surely ,

03:14.007 --> 03:15.407
We were hoping anyway, even if it was a fixed race,

03:15.407 --> 03:17.207
Even the words that are said in the official cavity'

03:17.207 --> 03:19.107
And the habit of picking up your toes,

03:19.207 --> 03:21.746
quit these habits together.

03:21.747 --> 03:27.707
Take a hint, don't let it clear up.

03:58.507 --> 04:01.407
It is also rainy today.

04:01.907 --> 04:04.107
Collapse the umbrella.

04:04.707 --> 04:09.306
Going home in the rain.
